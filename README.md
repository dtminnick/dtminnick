- 👋 Hi, I’m @dtminnick
- 👀 I’m interested in using R in support of continuous improvement work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to deploy R packages on CRAN.  I built my first package called fdistr, which makes it easy to generate frequency distribution tables.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to use R for data and statistical analysis for business process improvements.
- 📫 You can reach me at donnie.minnick@gmail.com
