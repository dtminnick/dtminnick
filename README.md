I'm a process expert working in the financial services industry and a data analysis enthusiast.  

I'm interested in exploring how to use data analysis and data science in support of my continuous improvement work.  I've acquired a working knowledge of R and RStudio over the past several years through coursework at Coursera and self-study.

I'm currently working on learning how to deploy R packages on CRAN.  I built my first packages called fdistr, which makes it easy to generate frequency distribution tables.
